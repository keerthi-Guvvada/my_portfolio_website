## 👩‍💻 About the Project

The project is a personal portfolio-style website featuring:

- A short bio/introduction
- An image
- Contact information
- A styled layout with gradients
- A clickable button with a simple JavaScript alert

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of core web technologies and apply them to a practical design.
